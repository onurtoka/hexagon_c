# External libzmq Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to enable external libzmq compilation and integration with the b_hexagon project.

## Changes Made

### 1. CMakeLists.txt Modifications

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/CMakeLists.txt`

- **Changed default behavior:** `USE_VENDORED_ZMQ` option now defaults to `OFF` (external libzmq)
- **Enhanced external libzmq detection:**
  - Improved pkg-config integration with version reporting
  - Manual search fallback with multiple search paths
  - Better error messages and troubleshooting guidance
  - Automatic `ZMQ_BUILD_DRAFT_API` definition for external builds
- **Comprehensive library and include path handling**

### 2. Documentation

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/docs/EXTERNAL_LIBZMQ_COMPILATION.md`
- Complete guide for compiling libzmq with draft API support
- Step-by-step instructions for different installation methods
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Environment variable configuration
- Validation commands

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/README.md`
- Updated build instructions to prioritize external libzmq
- Added quick installation section
- Referenced detailed compilation guide

### 3. Automation Scripts

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/compile_libzmq.sh`
- Automated libzmq compilation with correct options
- Configurable installation prefix (default: `/opt/zmq`)
- Draft API enablement (`ENABLE_DRAFTS=ON`)
- Automatic pkg-config file generation
- Installation verification with symbol checking

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/validate_external_libzmq.sh`
- Comprehensive validation of external libzmq installation
- Checks library files, headers, and draft API symbols
- Tests pkg-config integration
- Validates b_hexagon compilation with external libzmq
- Provides troubleshooting guidance

### 4. Project Configuration

**File:** `/workspaces/b_hexagon/b_hexagon/.gitignore`
- Added patterns for external build directories (`build_*`, `build_external`)

## Usage Workflow

### For External libzmq (Recommended)

1. **Compile libzmq:**
   ```bash
   ./compile_libzmq.sh /opt/zmq
   ```

2. **Build b_hexagon:**
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```

3. **Validate (optional):**
   ```bash
   ./validate_external_libzmq.sh /opt/zmq
   ```

### For Vendored libzmq (Fallback)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DUSE_VENDORED_ZMQ=ON
cmake --build build
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Performance:** External libzmq can be optimized for specific architectures
2. **System Integration:** Shared library reduces binary size and memory usage
3. **Maintenance:** Easier to update libzmq independently of the project
4. **Distribution:** Separation of concerns for packaging and deployment
5. **Development:** Faster incremental builds (libzmq not rebuilt every time)

## Technical Details

### Draft API Support
- All external libzmq builds include `ENABLE_DRAFTS=ON` for RADIO/DISH support
- Automatic `ZMQ_BUILD_DRAFT_API` definition in CMake for external builds
- Source code retains `#define ZMQ_BUILD_DRAFT_API` for compatibility

### Build System Integration
- Smart detection via pkg-config with fallback to manual search
- Multiple search paths for different installation layouts
- Comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting
- Environment variable support (`PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`)

### Backward Compatibility
- Vendored libzmq remains available via `USE_VENDORED_ZMQ=ON`
- All existing build procedures continue to work
- No changes to source code functionality

```

## Migration Notes

- **Existing builds:** Add `-DUSE_VENDORED_ZMQ=ON` to maintain current behavior
- **CI/CD systems:** Consider using external libzmq for faster builds
- **Production:** External libzmq recommended for optimized deployments
- **Development:** Either approach works; external libzmq provides faster iteration

This integration provides flexibility while maintaining the robustness and reliability of the b_hexagon project's ZeroMQ-based messaging architecture.
